# Food finder app!

Initially this project meant to be a food finder to someone looking around in a city, but when I went through [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/), I figured this could be more than that!
So I let client pass in different variables such as `tourism`, `religion`, `parking` or try it by **default** which is `catering` (and apparently could find restaurants).

### Remaining points to improve
1. `findAmenitiesNearby` inside `PlaceDetailService` could use some caching strategy.
2. Tests could be written for the `PlaceDetailService`.
3. Integration tests could be added by recording responses with [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/).
